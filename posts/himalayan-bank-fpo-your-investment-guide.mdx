Over the past decade, Nepal's stock market has shown remarkable resilience and growth, driven by economic reforms and a burgeoning middle class. The banking sector, in particular, has been a pivotal player in this growth narrative.

The banking sector remains at the forefront, contributing significantly to market capitalization. Himalayan Bank, with its strong financials and strategic initiatives, is positioned favorably within this context. Understanding these market dynamics is crucial for investors eyeing the FPO as part of a broader investment strategy.
