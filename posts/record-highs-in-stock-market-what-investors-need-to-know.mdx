## Introduction

In a remarkable turn of events, major U.S. stock indexes have surged to new record levels, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.5% on Thursday, surpassing its previous all-time high set just last week. This bullish momentum in the stock market is largely attributed to encouraging updates on economic indicators that have outperformed expectations. For retail investors, understanding the implications of these developments is crucial, as it offers both opportunities and potential risks in the current investment landscape.

The performance of key indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is often viewed as a barometer of economic health, reflecting investor confidence in market conditions.
