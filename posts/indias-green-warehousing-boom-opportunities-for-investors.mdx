# Introduction

The landscape of the global real estate market is witnessing a seismic shift towards sustainability, with India at the forefront of this transformation. The green warehousing sector in India is heralded as a beacon of sustainable development, projected to expand fourfold from 65 million square feet in 2022 to an astounding 270 million square feet by 2030. This growth trajectory, highlighted by the esteemed commercial real estate firm JLL, underscores a strategic pivot towards environmentally conscious infrastructure development. As climate change continues to dominate global discourse, businesses and governments alike are under mounting pressure to adopt greener practices. In India, this commitment is manifesting in the acceleration of green warehousing, offering a fertile ground for savvy investors seeking to align their portfolios with sustainable development goals.

### India's Economic and Regulatory Landscape

India's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, as pledged at the COP26 Summit, is driving regulatory changes that favor sustainable infrastructure projects. The government's policies promoting renewable energy and sustainable urban development are conducive to the growth of the green warehousing sector. Furthermore, the 'Make in India' initiative and the rise of e-commerce are boosting demand for warehousing space, providing additional impetus for sectoral growth.
