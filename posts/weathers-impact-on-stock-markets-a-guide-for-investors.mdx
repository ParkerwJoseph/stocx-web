Rain can disrupt supply chains, affect crop yields, and alter consumer behavior, which in turn can influence stock prices. This guide aims to provide retail investors with a comprehensive understanding of how to navigate these changes, offering actionable insights and strategies.

## Market Context

Understanding the broader market trends is crucial for investors. Weather conditions, like those in Ahmedabad, can exacerbate ongoing market trends or introduce new volatility.
